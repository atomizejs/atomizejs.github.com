# Installing AtomizeJS


## Components

AtomizeJS is made up of several components:

* Client-side libraries. These must be `<script/>`-included in your
  HTML:
    * [SockJS client](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client)
    * [cereal.js](https://github.com/atomizejs/cereal/blob/master/lib/cereal.js)
    * [atomize.js](https://github.com/atomizejs/atomize-client/blob/master/lib/atomize.js)

* Server. Currently, the AtomizeJS server is written in JavaScript for
  NodeJS. You should be able to install it with nothing more than `npm
  install atomize-server`.


## Repositories

* [atomize-server-node](https://github.com/atomizejs/atomize-server-node):
  The NodeJS server. This itself depends on atomize-client, cereal and
  [sockjs-node](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-node).
* [atomize-client](https://github.com/atomizejs/atomize-client): The
  AtomizeJS client library. This depends on
  [sock.js](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client) and cereal.
* [cereal](https://github.com/atomizejs/cereal): This is just an
  object serialisation library.
* [atomize-examples](https://github.com/atomizejs/atomize-examples):
  Some examples and tests for AtomizeJS.


## Requirements

AtomizeJS is currently still very alpha, and depends on some
bleeding-edge features of JavaScript. In particular, it depends on
[WeakMaps][] and more crucially [Proxies][] (which are soon to be
replaced by [Direct-Proxies][]).

### Client Requirements

* The only web browsers known to work currently are Firefox 8, or
  Chrome 17.
* If you are using Chrome, then you need to start Chrome as:
  `google-chrome --js-flags="--harmony-proxies --harmony-collections"`

### Server Requirements

Currently, the only AtomizeJS server requires [NodeJS][]. NodeJS uses
the [V8 JavaScript engine][V8]. Currently, no released version of
NodeJS comes with a sufficiently recent version of V8. Thus to prepare
NodeJS, please follow these steps:

1. Install the latest [V8][]. You need at least version 3.7. If you're
on Debian/Ubuntu then the easiest route is to grab and install the
packages from
[this PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ilya-novoselov/+archive/hemi/+packages).
2. Download the latest [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/#download) source.
3. Unpack it.
4. `./configure --shared-v8`
5. `make`, `make install` as usual.
6. `npm install atomize-server`

Then, when starting node, do so as:
    node --harmony-collections --harmony-proxies app.js
