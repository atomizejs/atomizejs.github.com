# API


<div id="client"></div>
## Client

Note that with the exception of the constructor, the complete client
API is available in the NodeJS server as shown above under the
`atomizeServer.atomize` field.


<div id="constructor"></div>
### - `Atomize(URL)` constructor

* Browser-side only
* Creates a new atomize client but does not connect immediately to the
  server
* Maximum one argument which is the URL to the AtomizeJS server
* If no URL is provided then:
    * If the `location.protocol` is `http` or `https` then a URL is
      constructed as `location.host + /atomize`
    * Otherwise offline client-local-only operation is assumed

{% highlight javascript %}
var atomize = new Atomize("http://localhost:9999/atomize");
{% endhighlight %}


<div id="connect"></div>
### - `connect()`

* Attempts to connect to the AtomizeJS server. If no URL was specified
  to the constructor, this is a no-op


<div id="onPreAuthenticated"></div>
### - `onPreAuthenticated`

* Assign to this the function that you wish to run once the client has
  connected to the server
* The function is passed two parameters:
    1. Any message received from the server. The function is first run
       as soon as the connection is established, and at this point
       there is no such message, so this parameter will be
       `undefined`. However, this function may be called multiple
       times which allows for challenge-response authentication
       mechanisms to be used. Subsequent invocations of this function
       occur only once a message has been received from the
       server. The message is the same object as SockJS provides to
       its `onmessage` callback
    2. The SockJS connection object. This allows you to `send` data to
       the server. This object is provided on every invocation of this
       function
* Once this function returns `true`, AtomizeJS assumes the client has
  successfully authenticated with the server, and so does not invoke
  this function again
* By default there is no authentication required, so by default, this
  function will never be called


<div id="onAuthenticated"></div>
### - `onAuthenticated`

* Assign to this the function that you wish to run once the client has
  authenticated with the server. By default, there is no authentication
  required
* No arguments are passed to the function


<div id="root"></div>
### - `root`

* The `root` object
* All objects and values reachable from the root object are available
  to all clients
* The initial value is the empty object `{}`


<div id="atomically"></div>
### - `atomically(txnFun, contFun)`

* Runs a transaction function
* Two arguments:
    1. The function to be run as a transaction. May return a value.
    2. The function to be run as a continuation once the transaction
    has committed. Will be passed the result of the first argument.

{% highlight javascript %}
atomize.atomically(function () {
    if (atomize.root.number % 2 === 0) {
        return "Even";
    } else {
        return "Odd";
    }
}, function (result) {
    console.log(result);
});
{% endhighlight %}


<div id="lift"></div>
### - `lift(obj)`

* Prepares an object for management by the AtomizeJS system
* One argument: the object to be managed
* Must be used before assigning an object into another AtomizeJS
  object; if you do not, the assignment will fail and a
  `NotATVarException` exception will be thrown
* Safe to use on both primitives and objects though is unnecessary for
  primitives
* Idempotent: calling lift on the same object multiple times will
  return the same managed AtomizeJS object
* It is safe to use lift outside of a transaction: this is because
  when used outside of a transaction, it implicitly creates and
  commits a transaction which merely passes the object through to the
  AtomizeJS server. This can't possibly fail, so you do not need to
  consider the possibility of such a trasaction retrying

{% highlight javascript %}
atomize.atomically(function () {
    atomize.root.obj = atomize.lift({a: "hello", b: 5});
    atomize.root.obj.c = atomize.lift({});
    atomize.root.obj.b = atomize.lift(6);
}, function () {});
{% endhighlight %}

Please note that currently, if you [`lift`][] in an object that has a
non-default `prototype` then the prototype does not get recreated by
other clients: the other clients will just see an object with a
prototype of `Object.prototype`. Additionally, only plain `Objects`
and `Arrays` are supported: trying to lift a `Function` will not work.


<div id="retry"></div>
### - `retry()`

* Indicates the transaction wishes to be suspended pending some change
* No arguments
* Upon retry, the effects of the transaction function are undone
* The transaction will be restarted when the values the transaction
  read prior to the `retry` have been modified
* Note that no statements that directly follow a [`retry`][] will ever
  be invoked: they are dead code

In the following example, the continuation will *only* be invoked with
a value `!== undefined`:

{% highlight javascript %}
atomize.atomically(function () {
    if (atomize.root.value === undefined) {
        atomize.retry();
    } else {
        var result = atomize.root.value;
        delete atomize.root;
        return result;
    }
}, function (result) {
    console.log(result);
});
{% endhighlight %}


<div id="orElse"></div>
### - `orElse(txnFuns, contFun)`

* An abstraction of `retry`
* Two arguments:
    1. A list of transaction functions
    2. A continuation
* The initial *current-transaction-function* is the function at index
  0 of the list
* If the *current-transaction-function* does not `retry` then it
  commits as normal, and the continuation is invoked as normal
* If the *current-transaction-function* hits `retry` then the *writes*
  of the *current-transaction-function* are undone and the
  *current-transaction-function* is now the next transaction function
  in the list. The new *current-transaction-function* is then invoked
* If all transaction functions `retry`, then a normal `retry` is
  issued for *all* objects read across all transaction functions

In the following example, at most one of the transaction functions
will commit. If both retry, then the overall `orElse` operation will
be restarted once any of the objects read by both transaction
functions have changed (in this case, the complete *read set* is
`atomize.root`, `atomize.root.a`, `atomize.root.b`; please see the
[background][] page for more details on *read sets*).

{% highlight javascript %}
atomize.orElse(
    [function () {
         if (atomize.root.a.toIncrement === undefined) {
             atomize.retry();
         } else {
             atomize.root.a.toIncrement += 1;
             return atomize.root.a.toIncrement;
         }
     },
     function () {
         if (atomize.root.b.toDecrement === undefined) {
             atomize.retry();
         } else {
             atomize.root.b.toDecrement -= 1;
             return atomize.root.b.toDecrement;
         }
     }], function (result) {
         console.log(result);
     });
{% endhighlight %}


<div id="inTransaction"></div>
### - `inTransaction()`

* Returns `true` if currently in a transaction and `false` otherwise
* No arguments
* Can be called both inside and outside a transaction


## Extended Client API

The following methods are available in the client and are used by the
[translation tool][translate] for browsers that do not yet support
[Proxies][]. If you wish, you can write code that directly uses this
API, and thus avoid the need to use the [translation tool][translate].

<div id="access"></div>
### - `access(obj, fieldName)`

* `access(a, b)` is the equivalent of `a.b`

<div id="assign"></div>
### - `assign(obj, fieldName, value)`

* `assign(a, b, c)` is the equivalent of `a.b = c`

<div id="enumerate"></div>
### - `enumerate(obj)`

* Is used in the translation of `for (a in b) ...` loops: rewritten to
    become `for (a in atomize.enumerate(b)) ...`

<div id="has"></div>
### - `has(obj, fieldName)`

* `has(a, b)` is the equivalent of `b in a`

<div id="erase"></div>
### - `erase(obj, fieldName)`

* `erase(a, b)` is the equivalent of `delete a.b`


<div id="server"></div>
## Server


<div id="create"></div>
### - `create(server, path, root)`

* Create a new AtomizeJS server
* Two mandatory parameters:
    1. HTTP server: typically returned from `http.createServer()`;
    2. Path within the server to provide the AtomizeJS service
* One optional parameter:
    3. The initial [`root`][] object. If omitted, the initial
    [`root`][] object will be a fresh empty object `{}`.
* Note the *client* is available from within the server by calling the
  `client` method on the returned object

{% highlight javascript %}
var http = require('http');
var atomize = require('atomize-server');

var httpServer = http.createServer();
var atomizeServer = atomize.create(httpServer, '[/]atomize');
httpServer.listen(9999, '0.0.0.0');

var atomizeClient = atomizeServer.client();
{% endhighlight %}


<div id="serverEvents"></div>
## Server Events


<div id="onConnection"></div>
### - `'connection'`

* Emitted when a new client connects to the server
* The listeners are passed a `client` object which can be used to
  directly communicate back to the client as part of any
  authentication scheme
* Authentication is considered complete when you set
  `client.isAuthenticated = true;`
* If no listeners are installed for this event, the server will
  immediately mark every connection authenticated: i.e. by default
  there is no explicit authentication
* The client object itself is also an event emitter


<div id="serverEventsPerClient"></div>
## Server Events Per Client


<div id="onClose"></div>
### - `'close'`

* Emitted when the client connection is closed
* The listeners are passed the `client` object


<div id="onData"></div>
### - `'data'`

* Emitted when data is received from the client as part of
  authentication.
* The listeners are passed two arguments:
    1. The message received from the client. This is the same message
       object that is emitted by the SockJS `'data'` event.
    2. The `client` object. This can be used to directly communicate
       back to the client as part of authentication steps.
* Authentication is considered complete when you set
  `client.isAuthenticated = true;`
* This event will never be emitted after `client.isAuthenticated` is
  `true`.


<div id="authExample"></div>
## Example of authentication and server events

The following example shows how to implement (trivial) authentication:
the client must send a `{text: "wibble"}` JSON object, and the server
must send back a `{text: "wobble"}` JSON object; and also how to
modify the [`root`][] object so that the `root.clients` object
contains an entry per client.

{% highlight javascript %}
var http = require('http');
var atomize = require('atomize-server');
var httpServer = http.createServer();
var port = 9999;

var atomizeServer = atomize.create(httpServer, '[/]atomize');
var atomizeClient = atomizeServer.client();
atomizeClient.atomically(function () {
    atomizeClient.root.clients = atomizeClient.lift({server: {}});
}, function () {
    atomizeServer.on('connection', function (client) {

        client.on('close', function (client) {
            atomizeClient.atomically(function () {
                delete atomizeClient.root.clients[client.connection.id];
            }, function () {
                console.log("Connection death: " + client.connection.id);
            });
        });

        client.on('data', function (message, client) {
            var text = JSON.parse(message).text;
            if (text === "wibble") {
                client.connection.write(JSON.stringify({text: "wobble"}));

                atomizeClient.atomically(function () {
                    atomizeClient.root.clients[client.connection.id] =
                            atomizeClient.lift({});
                }, function () {
                    console.log("New connection id: " + client.connection.id);
                    client.isAuthenticated = true;
                });
            } else {
                client.connection.write(JSON.stringify({text: "denied"}));
            }
        });
    });
});

console.log(" [*] Listening on 0.0.0.0:" + port);
httpServer.listen(port, '0.0.0.0');
{% endhighlight %}

Corresponding client side code might look like:

{% highlight javascript %}
function start () {
    atomize = new Atomize("http://localhost:9999/atomize");
    atomize.onPreAuthenticated = function (message, sockjs) {
        if (undefined === message) {
            // 1st time through
            sockjs.send(JSON.stringify({text: "wibble"}));
            return false;
        } else {
            return JSON.parse(message.data).text === "wobble";
        }
    };
    atomize.onAuthenticated = function () { // Ready to go!
    };
    atomize.connect();
}
{% endhighlight %}
