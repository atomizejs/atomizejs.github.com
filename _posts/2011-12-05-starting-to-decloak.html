title: Starting to decloak
---

Under 1 man-month of development done; AtomizeJS is public, but there
is much to do. The most major limitation is that of browser support:
currently only Firefox 8 and Chrome 17 are supported. This is because
they support experimental features of the next version of JavaScript
which AtomizeJS currently depends upon. I have some ideas about how to
support other browsers and doing this is my first priority, but it's
not the only thing on my to-do list.

There is also much work to be done on:

* Exception handling: particularly transactions that throw exceptions
  after they've been restarted. Having a good story on dealing with
  failure scenarios is very important.

* Garbage Collection: currently, any object that has been lifted into
  AtomizeJS will exist on the server forever. Distributed GC is on the
  whole quite a challenge. I have some ideas how to solve this, but
  it's not a straight-forward problem.

* Multi-node server support: it's pretty simple to imagine having
  multiple NodeJS servers all attached to the same AtomizeJS
  instance. This should be fairly simple to achieve: the lack of a
  SockJS client for NodeJS is the reason it doesn't work yet, but I
  could do a plain socket implementation.

* Presence: it's fairly simple to build a system where a new client
  makes its presence known to the other clients, though there are some
  open questions about naming clients. It's much harder currently for
  other clients to know about the loss of a client. Indeed, quite what
  loss means may vary from application to application. Having some
  mechanism for being able to indicate which clients currently exist,
  for varying degrees of exist, would be useful for a large number of
  applications.

* Security and partitioning: the focus of AtomizeJS is to make it
  easier to move more and more application logic to the browser
  side. However, there are always going to be applications which need
  to have some server-side component. One of the likely important
  areas here is to provide a means whereby the server can control
  which clients can read and write to which variables. Currently there
  is no security at all: any client can write and read to and from any
  object managed by AtomizeJS (provided they can get hold of it in the
  first place - objects do not have to be reachable via
  [`root`][]). It's easy to imagine needing private objects amongst
  different clients and the server.

* Libraries: AtomizeJS and STM in general provide some neat
  primitives. These are fairly low-level, but can be usefully combined
  to create more powerful patterns, for example the broadcast queue in
  the [getting started][] guide. I plan to create a set of libraries
  which capture many of these higher-level patterns.

* Optimisations: There are many optimisations that could be done both
  client and server side.

* Alternative servers: There's no reason why the server should just be
  implemented in NodeJS. For performance reasons, it might be a good
  idea to have other implementations in other languages.

At this stage, any and all [feedback][contact] is very welcome. I
realise that right now, without broader browser support, few of you
are going to start building your next world-changing application on
top of AtomizeJS. However, for the early-adopters out there and
everyone who's keen to have a play around and a quick read, I'd love
to know what you think of the project as a whole, how easy you find it
to write applications on AtomizeJS, whether you think the APIs make
sense and so forth. Please [get in touch][contact] with any thoughts
you have.
