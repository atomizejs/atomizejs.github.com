title: Dropping the dependencies
---

One of my highest priorities right now is to increase browser
compatibility. Supporting IE6 probably isn't going to happen, and even
IE7 is unlikely. IE8 would certainly be a nice to have given that as
of July 2011, about 60% of IE users are using IE8, though that will
change. I'd really love to avoid having to write different versions of
JavaScript for different browsers, but we shall see...

First up is getting rid of the dependency on [WeakMaps][] or Maps in
general. Simple
[Maps and Sets](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:simple_maps_and_sets)
are due to be in the next version of JavaScript. Without them, you
have problems telling the difference between certain types of key,
because when you do a plain `obj[key] = val`, the field name created
is just the string representation of `key`. Thus `1` and `"1"` are the
same thing, and every object is `[object Object]` - hardly very
useful. I need objects as keys.

This one I've managed to work around: I've managed to build an
implementation of a Map. Inevitably, it's a compromise, and it ends up
storing a unique ID in every object it touches. Currently, it does
that via `defineProperty` (in order to make it non-deletable,
non-rewritable and non-enumerable) which is broken in IE8, but I hope
to be able to work around that.

The much bigger problem is working around the lack of [Proxies][] in
older browsers. Initially, I'll have to build the API out so that you
can drive the proxy manually. This will mean that instead of writing
code like `a.b.c = x.y` you'll have to write code like
`a.get('b').set('c', x.get('y'))`. Yup, it's pretty grim, and I doubt
that'll be the worst of it. I'm hoping to have some sort of mechanised
translation, but seeing as you can write

{% highlight javascript %}
function MyFun (f) {
    atomize.atomically(f);
}
{% endhighlight %}

you're either going to have to do dynamic translation of any `f` that
arrives there (which is problematic because there's no standard way of
getting hold of the source of `f` - `.toSource()` is not standard), or
you're going to have to do whole program analysis in advance and
really prepare two different versions of every function and then
select at run time which version to run based on whether or not you're
inside a transaction. I've not made up my mind which one I prefer -
[comments welcome][contact] - but the first step will be to build out
the proxy API so that these things can be driven manually, even if the
syntax is pretty ugly.
