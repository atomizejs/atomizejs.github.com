A [couple of weeks ago](/2012/05/22/talking-at-lnug.html) I gave a
[talk](http://lanyrd.com/2012/lnug-may/coverage/) at the [London Node
User Group](http://lnug.org/). I thought it went pretty well and the
reaction both in person and on twitter afterwards seemed pretty
positive.

The video and [slides](/resources/LNUG_2012_05/slides.pdf) are now
available online.

Recently I've really been doing general improvements, tidying up of
the code and refactorings. Possibly not any exciting new features, but
the basic code is in much better shape and is much much closer to
properly enforcing the properties of JavaScript than before
(e.g. things like only being able to delete properties that are marked
configurable etc). Also a fairly major bug in the way [`retry`][] was
implemented has been found and fixed, and I've done a fair amount of
testing with the translation tool and generally trying to ensure that
the claims that I make about compatibility really are bourne out in
practise. Of course, IE is the most challenging target, but it is on
the whole managable (at least, up-to-date versions of IE are).

All of which means that I've bumped the versions of both the client
and server to 0.4.9. Hopefully after some more testing and minor bug
fixes I should be able to either move to a 0.5.0 or maybe even go to
0.9.0 to target a possible 1.0.0 release. Thus any feedback, comments,
questions or bug reports are [very eagerly requested][contact]!
