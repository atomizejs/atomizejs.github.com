title: Talk at London Node User Group
---

Tomorrow (23rd May 2012), I'm speaking about AtomizeJS at the
[London Node User Group](http://lnug.org/). This will be a talk
covering what AtomizeJS is, what problems it solves, why you should
use it, and what you can use it for. It would be great to have a good
audience, so if you're at all curious about AtomizeJS (or a seasoned
user of it!), please come along. Apparently there'll be beers and
pizza from 6:30pm!

Over the last few days I've been writing various demos using AtomizeJS
for this talk, which has been great as it's exposed lots of bugs
(which I've fixed), and again just reinforced that sometimes, hard
problems are just plain hard to solve!

Development has been a little slower over the last month as I've been
involved in various other projects. I spent an awful lot of time
hacking in a security layer for AtomizeJS. All the hooks are now
there, so you should be able to implement whatever security policies
you want, but it's actually not clear to me how you would want to
express such security policies. Or rather, whilst some ideas are
fairly attractive to me, managing to achieve them in JavaScript is
rather more painful than it ought to be. Having read around the
subject, it's clear that since almost no one else tries to solve this
problem, it's considered a hard problem. So I've left the hooks in but
am yet to try to make a big deal out of it.

The client now has some reconnection logic in it, so if it does lose
connection to the server, it should attempt to reconnect. However,
currently that's a little buggy because SockJS doesn't expose a
disconnect due to packet drops - there's a bug filed and hopefully it
should Just Work when the next version of SockJS comes out. Lots and
lots of other little bugs have been fixed: it turned out that much of
AtomizeJS was broken when writing nodejs-side code as a client of
AtomizeJS, but thankfully in developing some demos, that's been
exposed, and fixed.
